                <h2>The Project Gutenberg eBook of Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz </h2>

            <div>
<p>The rain beat heavily on the roof,
    swirled down the side walks and made
    tumbling torrents of the gutters. 
    Turning from the window in disgust,
    Peter dropped his baseball mitt on 
    the library sofa and started glumly 
    toward the stair. No practice to-day,
    doggone it! Why couldn't it rain on 
    Mondays and be clear on Saturdays 
    for a change? How was he to have the
    team in trim for the big match if this
    sort of thing kept up? </p>

    <p>Kicking crossly at each step, 
       Peter progressed toward the attic.
    Not to waste the day, he resolved to
    have a look at his fishing tackle. 
    The thought of the fishing trip he
    was soon to take with his grandfather 
    cheered him considerably and by the time 
    he had switched on the attic light and 
    dragged out the old chest where he kept 
    his treasures, he was whistling softly 
    to himself. On top of the chest lay two
    coarse sacks. They were neatly folded in 
    half and as Peter lifted them off he gave
    an amused little chuckle.</p>

    <p>I wonder what's happened in Oz lately,
    mused Peter, sitting down in front of the
     chest with the sacks on his lap. 
     I wonder whether Ozma knows what I did with
        the pirate's gold pieces and whether the 
        Gnome King has got into any more mischief.
        And thinking of that enchanting and 
        enchanted Kingdom, Peter forgot all 
        about his fishing tackle.</p>

    <p>Now many of you may have read or heard 
        of the marvelous Land of Oz, but Peter 
    had really been there; had met the Scarecrow
    and the wonderful Wizard; had kept the Gnome
    King from conquering the Emerald City and even
    discovered a pirate ship full of treasure. 
    The pirate who owned the ship had once been 
    a real pirate, so when Ozma, the little girl 
    ruler of Oz, transported Peter and the treasure
    back to Philadelphia, two of the bags of gold
    had been real gold and these bags had come with him.
    These very sacks that Peter held across his knees
    had once bulged with gold pieces. And those 
    of Peter's friends and relations who had sniffed
    at the story of his amazing journey to Oz never 
    had been able to explain them away.</p>
