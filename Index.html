                <h2> Biography:</h2>

                    <p> Hello there</p>

                    <p> My name is Michael Rivas. I am from Costa Rica. 
                        I consider myself a hard worker and good person. 
                        I move here to the states when I was 18 years old.
                        I was able to meet great people here and learrned english. 
                        I meet whos my wife 10 years ago and from then we have
                        created a family </p>

                    <p> I recently just became a father. I want to be a great 
                        example for my daugher since she was born last month 
                        on thr 6th. Its been the greatest experience ever. 
                        I never thought I was going to love this much.
                        We are still learning since she does not understand
                        when is day time or night time. But every little moment
                        is worth it. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="column" >
                <h2>Hobbies:</h2>

            <p> I would like to show in the gallery some of my hobbies that I have
                mentioned before. To me my best time is when I spend it with my family.
                Me and my wife love go on walks with our dog. Also, on of my biggest 
                passions is playing soccer. I was pretty close to make it pro in my country
                and since then, I have been playing just for fun. I love going to the gym 
                at least 3 to 5 times a week which helps me with the stress. To me the best 
                time to work out is at 5am. </p>

            <p> I have created a good relationship with good as well and is through the bible
                that I have found peace. I think every religion is important in this world; 
                however, the relationship created with God is essential in my life. I enjoy 
                going to church with my family. </p>

            <p>Lastly, one of my dreams is to visit as many countries I can. I have been blessed 
                to learn about some different cultures. Me and my wife were planning on going to 
                Europe during this summer, but with baby now in our lives we have to postpone this 
                trip to hipefully next year </p>

                <h2>Netlify Large Media Format</h2>

            <div>
    <p> Netlify Large Media, a Git Large File Storage (LFS)
        implementation, helps manage large assets like images,
        audio, and video files in Git repositories connected 
        to Netlify sites. It replaces these assets with text 
        pointer files in the repository, storing the actual 
        files on Netlify's servers. This reduces repository size,
        speeds up clones, and enables on-the-fly image transformations</p>

    <p> How it works:
        Large Media uses Git LFS, which is an extension to Git that allows
        you to track large files without bloating your repository. Instead 
        of storing the full binary file in the repository, LFS stores a pointer
        to the file on a remote server (in this case, Netlify's servers). 
        When you clone the repository, you only get the pointer, and the actual
        file is fetched on demand.  </p>

    <p> Benefits: 
        Smaller repositories: This means faster clones and easier 
        repository management. 
        Faster builds: Netlify can build your site faster because
        it only needs to clone the code, not all the large assets. 
        Image transformations: Netlify provides on-the-fly image 
        transformations, allowing you to serve different sizes of 
        the same image without storing multiple versions</p>

    <p> How to use it:
        Enable Large Media: You'll need to enable Large Media on your 
        Netlify site and in your local repository. 
        Specify tracked files: You'll use the git lfs track command
        to specify which files should be managed by LFS. 
        Push your changes: When you push your repository, Git will 
        store the pointers and upload the large files to Netlify's storage. </p>

    <p> Limitations:
        Large Media is tied to a specific site and cannot be used with 
        Deploy to Netlify buttons or repositories with multiple connected sites. 
        You cannot create a new site from a fork of a Large-Media-enabled repository. 
        Files tracked with Large Media are not available for build-time processing
        (e.g., using image processing plugins in your site's build process). 
        Large Media is not suitable for streaming audio or video files. </p>
