Description: Hello, this is a project that I will like to show you a little bit about me and personal stuff I would like to share about myself.
I will be sharing some of the things I like to do on my free time such as family and quality time, playing sports; mainly soccer, reading the Bible
and working out at least 5 times a week. Even though sometimes its hard I try walking up every morning early to meditate, connect with God and get 
ready to hit the gym. I created a logo with my initials
